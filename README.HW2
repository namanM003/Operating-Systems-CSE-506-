Empty placeholder for CSE-506 F'15 HW2 README file
Constraints:
	The PatternDB file should contain a maximum of 64 Patterns and each
pattern string length can be maximum of 63 (excluding \0 character). Hence
making a file size a maximum of 4KB

Design Decision:
	1. ) During amfs_write if I see a bad pattern in buffer I dont write
data to the file nor do I set the Extra Attribute for the file because the bad
pattern wasn't return.
